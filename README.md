# happy-garden

Gardening may seem like a relaxing hobby, but not in this game! Can you help a flower-loving cow keep all the plants watered? Look out for the scary fangflowers as they try to zap the cow. How long can you help it keep the garden happy?

When the game starts, a cow with a watering can appears in the garden, but there is only one flower. Every few seconds another flower appears or an existing flower begins to wilt. Use the arrow keys to move the cow to the wilted flowers and press the Space bar to water them. If any flower remains wilted for more than ten seconds, the game ends. But if the garden is happy for more than 15 seconds, one of the flowers mutates into a fangflower and tries to zap the cow.

The code begins by setting up the Actors—the cow and the flowers—in the garden. It then checks if any of the flowers have been wilted for more than ten seconds, and if the cow has been zapped by a fangflower. If any one of these conditions is True, the game ends. If not, the program checks for the other conditions.
